## Development

This project uses React, TypeScript, and Vite for a fast and modern development experience. ESLint is configured for code quality and consistency.

### Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config([
  globalIgnores(['dist']),
  {
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    extends: [
      ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
      ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
      ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
    ],
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
    },
  },
])
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules.

## Roadmap & Future Plans

- **Enhanced User Experience:** We are actively working on improving the user interface and overall experience.
- **More Tool Integrations:** Expect support for additional tools and platforms to further expand your workflow automation capabilities.
- **Custom Agent Creation:** Future updates will make it even easier to create and manage your own AI agents.
